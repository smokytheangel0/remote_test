# remote_test
a bash script for running tests only on raspberry pi after cross compilation on desktop
this is for rustlang's cargo, so it will only work with cargo on the desktop and on the pi

make sure you have your rpi ssh alias in your ssh config set to raspberry_pi,
or change the each occurence of raspberry_pi in the script to an alias of your choosing
